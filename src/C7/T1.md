## Simple sort
Including insertion sort, bubble sort
Sort collections by swaping elements. Since the averge number inversions is N*(N-1)/4, the lower bound of simple sorts is O(N^2)

## Shell sort
Diminishing increment sort. for example, do 5-sort, 3-sort, 1-sort in order
The increment squences could decide the time cost.

## Merge sort
Always take O(NlogN)
A case of divide and conquer. Because it has the lowest number of comparison and moving element is cheap in Java, it is the algorithm used in the standard Java library for generic sorting

## Quick sort
Because it has fewer data movement, it is the algorithm used in the standard C++ libary and Java library for primitive types
### Optimization
1. Use the median of the left, right and center elements as the pivot
2. Swap strategy
   1. i stop when the element is smaller than the pivot, j stop when the element is larger than the pivot. Swap elements when they both stop
   2. i and j both stop at the position where the element is equal to pivot, and swap them
   3. stop this strategy then i cross j, and swap the pivot element with the element pointed by i
3. Use a more efficient sorting algorithm for small arrays, such N < 10

## Quick Select -- linear solution for Kth smallest element(selection problem)
The same as quick sort
1. Choose a pivot {v}
2. Partition S - {v} into S1 and S2
3. Compare k with |S1|
   1. if k <= |S1|, quickSelect(S1, K)
   2. if k = |S1| + 1, then the pivot is the result
   3. if K > |S1| + 1, quickSelect(S2, K - |S1| - 1)

## Linear sort
### Bucket sort
O(M + N)
All the elements must be positive integers smaller than M
Use an array a of size M, read i in the elements and increase a[i] by 1, then read the array to produce a new sorted array/
### Radix sort
O(p(N + b)) p = passes, b = buckets
Perform bucket sort by digits, from the smallest to the largest
Counting Radix sort -- Use a count array instead of ArrayList
