Tree depth from 0 - N
Tree height from 0 - N 
## AVL tree
Running time is O(logN)
The hight of the left and right subtree can diff at most 1 (the height of an empty tree is -1).
## Balance an AVL tree
1. single rotation
For left-left and right-right insertion
k1 is the unbalanced tree 
k1->k2->k3 to k1<-k2->k3
2. double rotation
For left-right and right-left insertion
k1 is the unbalanced tree
k1->k2->k3 to k1->k3->k2 to k1<-k3->k2

## Splay tree
M consecutive operations take at most O(MlogN), so average running time is O(logN)
when a node is accessd, it is moved to the root
## Splaying
1. zig-zig
For left-left and right-right access path
k3 is the target
k1->k2->k3 to k1<-k2<-k3
2. zig-zag
For left-right and right-left access path
k3 is the target
k1->k2->k3 to k1->k3->k2 to k1<-k3->k2
