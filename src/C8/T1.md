# Disjoint Set
Support find and union
1. find(a) == find(b) if a and b are in the same set
2. union(a, b) merge the sets of a and b
Disjoint Set is usually represented as an array S, each entry S[i] represents the parent of the element, the parent of the root is -1

## Optimization
1. Union by size
Make the smaller tree the subset of bigger tree. 
We have to store the size of trees to perform this, so we have the entry of the root contain the negative of the size of its tree.
A sequence of M operations requires O(M) average time if union-by-size is used
union-by-height is another implementation of union-by-size with fewer updates
1. Path compression
find(x) would change the parent of every node on the path to root
Path compression would change the height of trees, so union-by-height would become union-by-rank(estimated ranks)
