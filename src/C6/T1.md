Priority Queue is a binary heap with heap order
Heap order means that each node is larger than its parent except the root

Three queues that support the merge operation efficiently
# Leftist Heap
NPL = null path length
For every node in heap, the NPL of the left child is at least as large as that of the right child
# Skew Heap
Its merge operation looks like that of leftist heap except that we always swap the children
# Binomial Queue
A collection of binomial trees(B0, B1, B2, etc.)
Its operations look like those of binary digit
