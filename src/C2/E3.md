NlogN would grow slower than N^((1+c)/logN^(1/2))
Suppose that NlogN would grow faster. Taking logs of both sides, we find that loglogN would grow faster than c*logN^(1/2). If L = logN, then we are claiming that logL grows faster than c*L^(1/2), or equivalently, (logL)^2 grows faster than c^2*L. But we know that (logL)^2 = o(L), so the assumption is false, proving the claim.
