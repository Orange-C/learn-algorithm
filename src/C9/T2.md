# Network Flow Problem
The minimum cut capacity is the maximum flow

s = start
t = sink

Gf = flow graph
Gr = residual graph
edge in Gr = residual edge

augmenting path = a path in the residual grapsh from s to t, the minimum edge in the path is the amount of flow that could be added to every edge of the path

## Initial State
1. Gf = graph such that all edges are zero
2. Gr = graph that equals to the original one

## Steps of algorithms
1. Find a augmenting path in Gr
2. Let m be the minimum edge of the augmenting path
3. Subreact m from every edge of the path in Gr, remove the edge if its value is zero.
4. Add m to every edge of the path in Gf
5. Add m to every edge of the path in the opposite direction in Gr
6. Terminate if t is unreachable for s in Gr, otherwise back to step 1
7. The maximum flow is the total flow of edges pointing to t in Gf

# Minimum Spanning Tree
A minimum spanning tree in a undirected graph G is a tree formed from graph edges that connect all the vertices of G at lowest total cost.
