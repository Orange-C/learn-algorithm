# Network Flow Problem
The minimum cut capacity is the maximum flow

s = start
t = sink

Gf = flow graph
Gr = residual graph
edge in Gr = residual edge

augmenting path = a path in the residual grapsh from s to t, the minimum edge in the path is the amount of flow that could be added to every edge of the path

## Initial State
1. Gf = graph such that all edges are zero
2. Gr = graph that equals to the original one

## Steps of algorithms
1. Find a augmenting path in Gr
2. Let m be the minimum edge of the augmenting path
3. Subreact m from every edge of the path in Gr, remove the edge if its value is zero.
4. Add m to every edge of the path in Gf
5. Add m to every edge of the path in the opposite direction in Gr
6. Terminate if t is unreachable for s in Gr, otherwise back to step 1
7. The maximum flow is the total flow of edges pointing to t in Gf

# Minimum Spanning Tree
A minimum spanning tree in a undirected graph G is a tree formed from graph edges that connect all the vertices of G at lowest total cost.

## Prim's Algorithm
Looks like Dijkstra's algorithm.
Choose a unknown vertex with smallest dv, update distances of all adjacent vertices w, dw = min(dw, C(v,w))

## Kruskal's Algorithm
Continually choose the edge with smallest cost if it does't cause a cycle.
Use union/find structure
1. if u and v are not in the same set, the edge(u,v) is accepted. if not, the edge(u,v) is rejected
2. stop when there is only one set / the number of edges equals to N - 1

# Application of DFS

## Biconnectivity
A conneted graph is biconnected if there are no vertices whose removal disconnects the rest of the graph.
The vertices whose removal would disconnects the rest of the graph are known as articulation points

Num(V) = the preorder number
Low(V) = the lowest number reachable for v by taking tree edges and then possibly one back edge

For root node, if it has two or more children, it is an articulation point
For other node V, V is an articulation point if it has one child w whose Low(w) >= Num(V)

## Euler Circuit
A graph has a Euler Circuit if all vertices of the graph have even degree (number of egdes)
A graph has a Euler path if it has only two vertices with odd degree

1. Start at V, run dfs until we are back to V, get a circuit path from V to V
2. If there are still untraversed edges, start at next node W with untraversed edges, run dfs, get a circuit path from W to W
3. Merge path V and path W (slice one of them and insert the other)
4. stop when there are no untraversed edges

# NP & NP-Completeness

NP = Problems that can be checked in polynomial time
NP-Complete = All NP problems can be reduced to NP-Complete problems
P  = Problems that can be solved in polynomial time
